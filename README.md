# ICE3D
A 3D solver based on two coupled PDEs for calculation of glaze and rime icing on aircraft surface.
Refer to a paper "Extension to the Myers model for calculation of three-dimensional glaze icing" (https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033212) published in Journal of Aircraft for the theoretical model and numerical method behind this solver.
